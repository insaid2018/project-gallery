 ## 2. **Title**
 #### **Street View House Numbers**

The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset is one of the most popular benchmarks for **object recognition** tasks in academic papers. The images were obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images, are hosted by **Stanford University**

 ##  3. **Motivation**
 ![enter image description here](https://production-media.paperswithcode.com/datasets/SVHN-0000000424-c12734ed_mMXUnWD.jpg)
- **Object recognition** and **image processing** has become one of the hottest topics in machine learning due to its vast and creative potential applications in the real world. 

- The ability to process visual information using machine learning algorithms can be very useful, such as the **Street View House Numbers (SVHN)** dataset is one of the most popular ones.

 ## 4. **Goal**
 The original purpose of this dataset is to solve a harder problem: that of **recognizing digits** and **numbers** in **natural scene** images.
<a name=Section5></a>

## 5. **Data**
This dataset contains two .zip files that contain over **90k** labelled real-world images of house numbers taken from Google Street View. The sequence of numbers in the images are of bounded length.

-   There are **10 classes**, 1 for each digit. Digit '1' has label 1, '9' has label 9 and '0' has label 10.
